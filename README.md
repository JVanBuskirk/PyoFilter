Filter Plug in using Juce and Pyo

This is my first attempt to build plug-ins using Juce and Pyo.

Audio Units build and work well in some hosts.  VST plugins will build, but will not load into any host.
I am a novice C++ programmer which probably explains the known issues.

You must have Pyo installed to run the plug-in.

This plug-in is based on:

Olivier BÃ©langer's Pyo embedded tutorial.
