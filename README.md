Filter Plug in using Juce and Pyo

This is my first attempt to build plug-ins using Juce and Pyo.

Audio Units build and work well in some hosts.  VST plugins will build, but will not load into any host.
I am a novice C++ programmer which probably explains the known issues.

Known Issues
OSX
- Audio Units will build and load into Reaper and Logic but fail to load into Max, Juce Plugin Host,Tracktion.
- VST will build but fail to load into any host

Win
